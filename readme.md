### GUI wrapper for Ventoy

![](https://i.imgur.com/qI6cQyF.png)

This is a simple GTK wrapper for [Ventoy](ventoy.net) making it's console interface into GTK python app.

Everything is as simple as pie. 
- Download repository. You can either use `git clone https://github.com/smth-0/Venpy` or downloading from github as tar or zip file.
- Unpack files out of archive if you downloaded repo as such.

Install using `.sh` file provided in folder:
- Open terminal in folder with repository files (can be done by right clicking in the folder and selecting "open terminal" in most file managers).
- Run `run.sh` by typing in `./run.sh` and pressing enter.
- This will also install Venpy, and you can now launch Venpy by going into your Desktop Enviroment apps list and clicking on Venpy icon.

Or alternatively you can run it terminal way, without installation:
- Open terminal in folder with repository files (can be done by right clicking in the folder and selecting "open terminal" in most file managers).
- Run main.py with python by typing in `python3 main.py` and pressing enter. Root password will be asked if needed.

#### Make sure you have pip3 installed!
Comes with 1.0.29 [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html). Pull requests are welcome!

## Plans for later:
- Make Ventoy updatable within GUI.
- Add support for more Ventoy features.
- Provide installation result after the install.
